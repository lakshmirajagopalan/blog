Hi, I am lakshmi. A chennaiite with passion for computer science and gaming.
When I am bored of the sitting for days before the computer, or when the thought of my life hits me, I travel with my husband. 

Professionally, I am a sofware engineer with 6 years of experience in Scala and functional programming. My interests includes search-engines, databases, system designs and functional programming (Ofcourse!).

Connect with me at: **[404] BirdPerson** in Steam. More info on my games at [dotabuff](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/144760510)..
